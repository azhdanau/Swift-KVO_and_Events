This project contains two mechanisms.
1) Implementing KVO via PHObservable class. This class is some kind of wrapper which can be used to get behaviour similar to Obj-C KVO.
2) PHEventsCenter class provide extended mechanism of sending events in application similar like NSNotificationCenter do.

You can find examples of usage in Test.swift file.
